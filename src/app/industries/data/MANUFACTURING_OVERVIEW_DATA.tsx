      "Manufacturing faces unprecedented challenges in the era of Industry 4.0. Global competition intensifies daily, supply chains grow increasingly complex and vulnerable to disruption, skilled labor becomes scarcer as experienced workers retire, and customers demand mass customization at commodity prices. Meanwhile, margin pressures persist as raw material costs fluctuate and operational expenses rise",
      "Digital transformation Industry 4.0 is no longer a competitive advantage but a survival requirement. Manufacturers leveraging IoT sensors, AI/ML analytics, robotics, digital twins, and cloud computing create “smart factories” that are more efficient, flexible, resilient, and responsive to market changes"
