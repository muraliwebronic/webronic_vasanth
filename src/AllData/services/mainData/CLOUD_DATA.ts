  faq: {
    heading: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    items: [
      {
        question: "How long does cloud migration take?",
        answer: "Timeline depends on the number and complexity of applications. Small migrations (10-20 applications) typically complete in 3-6 months. Large enterprise migrations can take 12-24 months. We use phased approaches to deliver value early."
      },
      {
        question: "Will migration cause downtime?",
        answer: "Most migrations can be executed with zero or minimal downtime using blue-green deployment strategies, data replication, and careful cutover planning. Critical applications typically experience <4 hours of downtime during final cutover."
      },
      {
        question: "How much will cloud migration cost?",
        answer: "Migration costs typically range from 10-20% of annual infrastructure spend. A company spending $500K annually on infrastructure might invest $50-100K in migration. However, post-migration savings usually recover this investment within 12-18 months."
      },
      {
        question: "Is cloud more secure than on-premise?",
        answer: "Cloud platforms offer enterprise-grade security capabilities often exceeding what organizations can implement on-premise. However, security is a shared responsibility. We implement comprehensive security controls to ensure cloud deployments are highly secure."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens to our data during migration?",
        answer: "We use secure data transfer methods including encrypted connections and physical data transfer appliances for large datasets. Data integrity is verified at every step with zero tolerance for data loss."
      },
      {
        question: "Can we migrate back to on-premise if needed?",
        answer: "Yes, though rare. We design architectures avoiding vendor neutral where possible. However, cloud first services may make reversing migration complex and expensive."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you handle compliance requirements?",
        answer: "Cloud platforms offer compliance certifications for most regulatory frameworks (HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC 2). We implement additional controls specific to your compliance requirements and assist with audits."
      },
      {
        question: "What about our legacy applications?",
        answer: "Legacy applications can be migrated using lift-and-shift approaches with minimal modification. Alternatively, we can modernize during migration or help you identify SaaS replacements."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you control cloud costs?",
        answer: "We implement comprehensive cost management including right-sizing, reserved instances, auto-scaling, monitoring, and monthly optimization reviews. Typical clients see 30-40% cost reductions through optimization."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you provide ongoing cloud management?",
        answer: "Yes, we offer managed cloud services including 24/7 monitoring, security management, cost optimization, performance tuning, and support."
