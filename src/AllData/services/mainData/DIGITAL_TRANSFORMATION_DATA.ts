      {
        question: "How long does digital transformation take?",
        answer: "Transformation timelines vary based on scope and organizational readiness. We use phased approaches delivering value throughout the journey, not just at the end."
      },
      {
        question: "What does digital transformation cost?",
        answer: "Investment depends on organization size and scope. We provide detailed cost estimates after initial assessment."
      },
      {
        question: "Do we need to replace all our systems?",
        answer: "Not necessarily. Our approach is to keep systems providing value, integrate legacy systems via APIs, replace only when necessary, and use gradual migration instead of 'rip and replace'."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you ensure employee adoption?",
        answer: "Change management is embedded throughout with early stakeholder involvement, comprehensive training programs, a super-user network, continuous support, while celebrating wins and recognizing adopters."
      },
      {
        question: "Can we transform incrementally?",
        answer: "Yes. We recommend phased transformation: start with high-value, lower-risk initiatives, build momentum with quick wins, gradually expand scope, and learn and adjust as you go."
      },
      {
        question: "What if we don't know where to start?",
        answer: "Our Digital Strategy Workshop spanning 3-5 days provides a current state assessment, vision development, prioritized roadmap, and a clear starting point."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you measure transformation success?",
        answer: "We track metrics across Business (revenue growth, cost savings), Customer (satisfaction, retention), Operational (productivity, quality, cycle time), and Financial (ROI, payback period, NPV)."
      },
      {
        question: "What's your role vs our team's role?",
        answer: "It's a partnership model. We provide strategy, expertise, implementation, and best practices. You provide business knowledge, decision-making, and resources. Together we execute transformation, manage change, and achieve outcomes."
      },
      {
        question: "Can transformation work with our legacy constraints?",
        answer: "Yes. We specialize in transforming organizations with legacy systems over 20 years old, manual production tracking, regulatory constraints, budget limitations, and risk-averse cultures. Our methodology accommodates real-world constraints."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens after transformation completes?",
        answer: "Transformation is continuous, involving ongoing optimization, an innovation pipeline, emerging technology adoption, and building a continuous improvement culture. We offer ongoing partnership or transition to your team."
