  // 8. FAQ
  faq: {
    heading: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    items: [
      {
        question: "How do I know if I need WordPress or Next.js?",
        answer: "Choose WordPress when your team needs to update content frequently without developer help, you want access to thousands of plugins for specific features, you're working with a moderate budget, or you need a standard business website or blog. Choose Next.js when performance is absolutely critical (sub-2-second load times), you need complex interactions or web application features, you want the most modern architecture with perfect SEO, or you have development resources for ongoing maintenance.",
        answerFooter: "We'll evaluate your specific needs, technical capabilities, budget, and long-term goals during our consultation to recommend the right platform. Sometimes the answer is a combination: WordPress as a headless CMS with Next.js frontend."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the realistic timeline for my website project?",
        answer: "Project scope depends primarily on complexity and your team's availability. Factors that affect timeline include design revisions, content preparation, stakeholder availability, third-party integration complexity, and custom feature requirements.",
        answerFooter: "We provide a detailed timeline during the discovery phase, with milestones and dependencies clearly mapped. Projects typically move faster when you have content ready and can provide timely feedback during design phases."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I update website content myself, or do I need to hire you every time?",
        answer: "You can definitely update content yourself. That's why we use content management systems. WordPress provides an intuitive admin panel similar to Microsoft Word. Add pages, write blog posts, upload images, update menus—all without touching code. Most clients feel comfortable after 1-2 hours of training. Next.js sites include an admin panel (Contentful, Sanity, or similar) for content updates. Slightly less intuitive than WordPress but still manageable for non-technical users.",
        answerFooter: "We provide training sessions, video tutorials, and written documentation. For ongoing content updates beyond your capacity, our maintenance plans include content update hours."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if something breaks after launch?",
        answer: "All projects include post-launch support covering bug fixes and issues directly related to our work. The length varies by project size. After that period, our maintenance plans cover: Security issues (patched immediately), Compatibility problems (fixed as part of regular updates), Performance degradation (monitored and optimized), Minor bugs (fixed during regular maintenance), Emergency support (available 24/7 for critical issues).",
        answerFooter: "For issues outside our scope (third-party plugin conflicts, hosting problems, client-added code), we can fix them on an hourly basis or as part of your maintenance plan."
      },
      {
        question: "Will my website work on all devices and browsers?",
        answer: "Yes. Every website we build is: Fully responsive (adapts to all screen sizes), Mobile-first (designed for smartphones first), Touch-friendly (proper button sizes and spacing), Cross-browser compatible (tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge), Fast on mobile networks (optimized for 3G and 4G), Tested on real devices (not just emulators).",
        list: [
          "iPhone (multiple models)",
          "Android phones",
          "iPads",
          "Android tablets",
          "Windows laptops",
          "Macs",
          "Older devices when relevant to your audience"
        ],
        answerFooter: "Given that 60%+ of traffic comes from mobile devices, responsive design isn't optional. It's the foundation of everything we build."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you handle SEO?",
        answer: "SEO happens in two stages: Technical SEO (included in every project) includes Semantic HTML structure, Optimized meta tags (title, description), Schema.org structured data, XML sitemap, Clean URL structure, Image optimization with alt text, Fast page load speeds, Mobile optimization, and Internal linking structure. Ongoing SEO (separate service) includes Keyword research and strategy, Content creation and optimization, Link building campaigns, Local SEO optimization, Competitive analysis, and Monthly reporting and adjustments.",
        answerFooter: "The technical foundation we build positions your site to rank well. Ongoing SEO services help you compete for valuable keywords in your industry."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I own the website, or am I locked into working with you?",
        answer: "You own everything. Upon final payment, you receive: Complete source code, All design files, All content and media, Full admin access, and Documentation. You can: Host anywhere you choose, Hire any developer for future work, Make any changes you want, Keep or remove our branding.",
        answerFooter: "No vendor lock-in. No proprietary systems. No recurring fees unless you choose our maintenance services. Complete ownership and freedom."
      },
      {
        question: "What about website security?",
        answer: "Security is built into every site we create. Technical Security includes SSL/HTTPS encryption (always), Secure hosting configuration, Regular software updates, Strong password policies, Two-factor authentication options, File permission hardening, and Security headers implementation. WordPress-Specific security includes Security plugins (Wordfence or Sucuri), Login attempt limiting, Firewall protection, Malware scanning, Database security, and Admin area protection. Ongoing Protection (maintenance plans) includes Security monitoring, Immediate patch application, Regular security audits, Backup verification, and Intrusion detection.",
        answerFooter: "For e-commerce sites handling payment data, we ensure PCI compliance through proper payment gateway integration. Payments process through Stripe, PayPal, or similar services—never stored on your server."
      },
      {
        question: "Can you migrate my existing website without losing SEO rankings?",
        answer: "Yes. We've migrated hundreds of websites while preserving SEO value. Our Migration Process: Audit current site's SEO profile, Document all URLs and rankings, Export all content and media, Rebuild on new platform, Set up proper 301 redirects (old URLs to new URLs), Verify redirect implementation, Test all internal links, Submit updated sitemap to search engines, Monitor rankings post-migration, and Make adjustments as needed.",
        list: [
          "Search rankings preserved",
          "Backlinks maintained",
          "Domain authority protected",
          "Indexed pages transferred",
          "User accounts migrated (if applicable)",
          "Order history preserved (for e-commerce)"
        ],
        answerFooter: "We launch during low-traffic hours to minimize impact."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I need changes or new features after launch?",
        answer: "Websites evolve with your business. We handle post-launch work through several approaches: Included Support (bug fixes and issues directly related to our work are covered at no charge for a specified period), Maintenance Plans (include content updates, minor feature additions, ongoing optimization, and priority support), Project-Based Work (for major features or redesign elements, we scope the work and provide a fixed quote), and Hourly Support (for occasional updates and small fixes outside a maintenance plan).",
        answerFooter: "Most clients find a maintenance plan provides the best value for ongoing work."
