        question: "How long does custom software development take?",
        answer: "Timelines vary by complexity. We use Agile/Scrum (2-week sprints) to deliver working software continuously, not just at the end."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you provide ongoing support?",
        answer: "Yes. We offer bug fixes, performance monitoring, security updates, feature enhancements, and SLAs post-launch."
      },
      {
        question: "Will we own the source code?",
        answer: "Yes. Upon final payment, you own the complete source code, documentation, and IP with no licensing restrictions."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you ensure code quality?",
        answer: "We use code reviews, automated testing (unit, integration, e2e), static analysis, and security scanning on every commit."
