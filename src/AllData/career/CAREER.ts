        "I start around 10 AM (flexible hours are great). Morning standup at 10:30 with my team for a quick sync on what everyone's working on. Then I dive into coding, currently building a new feature for our e-commerce platform. Our code review culture is fantastic; I learn something new from every review. Lunch at our subsidized cafeteria (₹40 for a full meal). Sometimes we play table tennis after lunch, which is a great way to recharge. Afternoons are for focused work or pair programming sessions. We have 'no meeting Wednesdays' which I love for deep work. Thursdays we have tech talks. Last week someone presented on GraphQL, super interesting. I usually wrap up by 6:30 PM. No pressure to stay late unless there's a genuine deadline (rare). Fridays we sometimes do team outings. We recently went to an escape room.",

        "I came from a research background and was nervous about industry. Webronic made the transition smooth. I work on manufacturing quality inspection using computer vision models to detect defects. Seeing my model deployed in a factory, running 24/7, inspecting thousands of parts... that's incredibly satisfying. The team is supportive. When I struggled with production deployment, senior engineers patiently helped me learn Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD. There’s zero judgment for asking questions. I'm currently pursuing my AWS ML certification, and the company is sponsoring it. The 20% innovation time is real; I'm experimenting with transformer models for a side project.",
